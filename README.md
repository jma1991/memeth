## Overview

This workflow is used to analyse Illumina methylation arrays at the probe level. It performs quality control, filtering, normalization, data exploration and differential methylation testing.

## Installation

Install Snakemake using the conda package manager:

```console
$ conda create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake
```

Deploy the workflow to your project directory:

```console
$ git pull https://github.com/zifornd/arrays projects/arrays
```

## Usage

Configure the workflow by editing the `config.yaml` file:

```console
$ nano config/config.yaml
```

Define the samples by editing the `samples.tsv` file:

```console
$ nano config/samples.tsv
```

Execute the workflow and install dependencies:

```console
$ snakemake --cores all --use-conda 
```
